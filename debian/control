Description: openmediavault timeshift plugin
 Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality
 similar to the System Restore feature in Windows and the Time Machine
 tool in Mac OS.
 .
 Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental
 snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots
 can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system.
